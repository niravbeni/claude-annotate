export const DEFAULT_TEXT = `My grandmother arrived in London in 1972, carrying nothing but a worn leather suitcase and her mother's gold cross. She was seventeen, barely spoke English, and knew no one.

The boarding house on Kentish Town Road smelled of boiled cabbage and damp wool. Nonna would lie awake at night listening to unfamiliar sounds - the rumble of the Northern Line beneath the floorboards, voices speaking a language that felt like stones in her mouth. Fear lived in her chest then, a hard knot just below her ribs that made breathing deliberate work.

In "Under Western Eyes," Joseph Conrad writes: "Words are the great enemies of reality." When I interviewed Nonna last month, she described learning English exactly like that - every word betraying what she meant, reality slipping away the moment she tried to speak.

By 1954, she'd found work at a textile factory in Hackney. The other women taught her curse words before they taught her please and thank you.

Years later, a letter came from her sister. Their mother had passed away some time ago. It was difficult news to receive.`;
